# Go Api Webserver
This project is an organization model and with a practical example of how to create a client server API in golang to render html and communicate with a backend API.
We have two APIs, one for front-end and one for the back-end, the front-end API consumes back-end APIs all native to Go, without using golang and Js frameworks.
